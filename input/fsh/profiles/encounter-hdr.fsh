/* Admission diagnosis and discharge diagnosis as such does not exist in the EHN HDR data set.
All information about diagnosis should be included in diagnostic summary, which could be represented by diagnosis element of the Encounter.
Diagnosti summary according to the EHN HDR guideline uses two different categories of conditions:
1. category
- POA Present on admission
- HAC Hospital acquired condition
- NA Not applicable or unknown

2. Treatement class
- treated
- other

Category and treatement class should be mandatory (1..1).
I propose to model it at the condition resource level and don't use encounter diagnosis.use element
otherwise there might be discrepancies and confusion.
